# Stock Price Predictor
This is a practice project to learn and understand core concepts of AI/ML. 

## Features
- Uses historical stock price data.
- Implements Random Forest and linear regression models.
- Visualizes stock data as well as actual vs predicted prices.

## Project Details
The data used in this project was gotten from the Tiingo API. More details can be found at this link: https://www.tiingo.com/. 
I used historical stock price data starting from **January 1st, 2020** until **July 26th, 2025**. 
To avoid rate limits, I saved this data as a CSV. The two models used are Linear Regression and Random Forest.
